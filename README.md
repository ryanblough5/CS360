Briefely summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I created an event tracker app that gives the user the ability to add or edit anything they need to attend and notifies them of upcoming events.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I tried to keep the UI design as simple as possible, and not allow it to become to cluttered with things, I've found that keeping designs of apps as simplistic as possible really helps someone in using it.

How did your approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
My approach to the coding process was to work on one thing at a time and not get overwhelmed with trying to do too much at once, allowing myself to focus on one thing allowed me to perfect an aspect of the app and then move onto the next thing.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested the code by running it through the debug on Android Studio to see if any syntax errors or conditional errors appeared, once I was able to determine that the code would function without flagging something, I knew that the app was successful. The testing process is probably one of the most important things that a programmer does, because the last thing that they want to do is to have their code fail after it launches because of a simple syntax error.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
As a person who to put it mildly is artistically challenged, I struggled with making the app look good. I created it mainly to just function and wasn't too harsh on myself when something didn't look quite how I wanted it to.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel as though as was successful in making the app function while keeping the design simple. Because of its simplicity, the app will funciton while the user shouldn't have much difficulty in manuvering it.
